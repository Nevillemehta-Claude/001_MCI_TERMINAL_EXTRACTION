- Batch 11 ingested (lines 751-825). Shutdown Sequence: 5 steps (Close WebSocket, Save session state, Generate report, Clear auth, Redirect to login) with progress bar. Header Component: 64px height, #1E293B background, elements include logo, token countdown, LIVE indicator, End Session button. UXMI Component Library: 7 components (Tooltip, Button, Input, Spinner, ProgressBar, Toast, ErrorDisplay) in src/client/uxmi/. UXMI Golden Rules: tooltip for every interactive element, visible feedback for every action, progress indicator for every wait. Continuing.
- Batch 10 ingested (lines 676-750). C3 Component Diagram continued: API Layer routes - Telemetry Router (/api/telemetry/stream), Config Router (/api/config/*). Service Layer: PreIgnitionScanner (scanner.ts, runAllChecks(), validateCheck()), KiteTokenService (kite.ts, getTokenStatus(), getTimeToExpiry()), AnthropicService (anthropic.ts, listModels(), selectModel()). State Management: SystemStateMachine (DORMANT→ACTIVE→SHUTDOWN), TelemetryEmitter (SSE Broadcast), Constitutional box (CR-001 to CR-004, INVIOLABLE RULES). Continuing.
- Batch 8 ingested (lines 525-599). WebSocket test continued: error/close handlers, heartbeat every 30 seconds. Test trading events via [out-of-scope-api].[out-of-scope-broker].markets. Troubleshooting: connection refused → check keys, auth failed → verify paper keys. Step 2.2 Design WebSocket Manager Architecture: Claude prompt for production-grade manager with exponential backoff (1s→2s→4s→8s→max 30s), multiple streams (trade_updates, account_updates), heartbeat, graceful shutdown, Zustand telemetryStore integration. Continuing.
- Batch 14 ingested (lines 976-1050). Error Recovery Flows continued: Token Expired at 6:00 AM IST (CR-004) - modal forces Re-Authenticate or End Session. WebSocket Disconnection - auto-reconnect 3 times, toast notifications, error modal if failed. PART XI Keyboard Shortcuts: Ctrl+Enter (Validate/Ignite), Ctrl+R (Re-run Scanner), Escape (close modal), Tab/Shift+Tab (navigate), Space (toggle/select), Ctrl+Q (End Session). All shortcuts shown in tooltips. Document Control section starting. Continuing.

Continuing.
- Batch 10 ingested (lines 676-750). Real-time updates via SSE, stale data amber indicator. CR-002 compliance: show BOTH entries for same symbol on different backends, color-code by backend, NEVER auto-reconcile. CR-003 compliance: ONLY descriptive, NEVER prescriptive, ALWAYS show disclaimer. Phase 4 Shutdown Confirmation Modal: session summary (duration, backends, positions, P&L), note "positions remain on broker platforms", checkbox to clear token data. Continuing.

Cursor Cmd+K inline edit instructions. Continuing.
- Batch 7 ingested (lines 450-524). Phase 2 WebSocket Integration (4-5 days): Replace simulated data with real [Out-of-Scope-Broker] streams for positions, orders, market data. Step 2.1 Prototype in Replit: Create isolated test before modifying production. Node.js with ws package. [Out-of-Scope-Broker] WebSocket URL: wss://[out-of-scope-api].[out-of-scope-broker].markets/stream.

- you have missed the point. like you said you will need to scan the json and then first provide me the response to my query. generate the table of files that you read in these immediate sessions in this terminal since the past 24 hours. just the names of the files you have read and ingested in your memory. do this slowly and steadly.
