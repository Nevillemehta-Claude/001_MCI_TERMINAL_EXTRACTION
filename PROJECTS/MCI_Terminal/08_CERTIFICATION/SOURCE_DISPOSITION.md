## DISPOSITION OPTIONS

### Option A: ARCHIVE (Recommended)

```
# Compress and archive to cold storage
cd ~/.claude/projects/-Users-nevillemehta/
gzip -k b8937bc2-ac10-4287-8ced-af96ac5f6f0b.jsonl
mv b8937bc2-ac10-4287-8ced-af96ac5f6f0b.jsonl.gz ~/Archives/claude-sessions/
```

**Reason:** Preserves original for potential future reference while freeing active storage.

### Option B: DELETE

```
# Remove after verifying extraction
rm ~/.claude/projects/-Users-nevillemehta/b8937bc2-ac10-4287-8ced-af96ac5f6f0b.jsonl
```

**Reason:** Extraction is complete; original no longer needed.

### Option C: RETAIN

```
# Keep as-is for continued reference
# No action required
```

**Reason:** Active development may require session continuation.
