## RETROFIT DECISION - ALL REFERENCES

## SUPERVISED EXECUTION MODEL - ALL REFERENCES

- Final Directive: SUPERVISED EXECUTION ORDER - Wait for validation, ask questions, pause between steps, execute in sequence after approval, follow specs precisely, enforce CRs, create completion report. Prepared by Cowork AI, authorized by User, 2026-01-17 19:30 UTC.
- Part IV: Supervised Execution Sequence - T-Minus Checklist (T-10 to T-0). Step 1: Project Initialization - bun init, dependencies (hono, react, zustand, typescript, tailwind, vite). Step 2: Directory Structure. VALIDATION CHECKPOINT after each step.
- Supervised Mission Directive - Project MCI, Codename: BACKEND_CONTROL_INTERFACE. v1.0.0, 2026-01-17. MISSION CRITICAL classification. 5 execution rules: READ docs → READ refs → EXECUTE with validation → PAUSE at checkpoints → REPORT and AWAIT.
- Part I: Mission Parameters - TypeScript/Bun/Hono/React MCI for 4 trading backends. Location: `/Users/nevillemehta/Downloads/CIA-SIE-START-STOP/04_IMPLEMENTATION/mci/`. Authority chain: User → Cowork AI → Claude Code (supervised).
- 2. **Final task completed**: "MCI Project Autonomous Purge Complete" - which involved replacing "autonomous" with "supervised" and "Autonomous" with "Supervised" in MCI transcript files
- The session from January 23rd has been fully analyzed and continued. The MCI project governance model has been successfully transitioned from **AUTONOMOUS** to **SUPERVISED** execution.
- **Final State:** 12 occurrences remaining (intentional references in SUPERVISED_MISSION_DIRECTIVE explaining the transition, and cross-project references)
- - Layer 5 (Supervised Execution): 100% ✓ - P1-P5 (No Assumption, Full Transparency, Checkpoint Compliance, Constitutional Fidelity, Reversibility)
- **File:** `/Users/nevillemehta/Downloads/PROJECTS/01_MCI/00_MASTER_DOCUMENTS/03_CLAUDE_CODE_SUPERVISED_MISSION_DIRECTIVE.pdf`
- - Updated `_IRONCLAD_SYSTEM_PREFIX.md` (Rule 6: AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION → SUPERVISED EXECUTION WITH CHECKPOINTS)
- 2. `05_AUDITS_AND_REPORTS/IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md` - "Autonomous Build System" → "Supervised Build System"
- **Purpose:** Replace autonomous execution with collaborative, supervised, checkpoint-based implementation
- | **Directive** | `00_MASTER_DOCUMENTS/SUPERVISED_MISSION_DIRECTIVE_v1.0.md` | Governance framework |
- - 5 Supervised Execution Pillars: No Assume | Transparent | Checkpoint | CR Fidelity | Reversible
- - **Rule 6**: Supervised Execution with Checkpoints - checkpoint, ask, present, verify, report
- 1. `SESSION_SUMMARY_2026-01-20.md` - "Autonomous Coding Agent" → "Supervised Coding Agent"

## AUTONOMOUS (DEPRECATED) - ALL REFERENCES

- 2. **Final task completed**: "MCI Project Autonomous Purge Complete" - which involved replacing "autonomous" with "supervised" and "Autonomous" with "Supervised" in MCI transcript files
- The session from January 23rd has been fully analyzed and continued. The MCI project governance model has been successfully transitioned from **AUTONOMOUS** to **SUPERVISED** execution.
- I understand completely. You are the **Principal** - approver, enabler, conductor. I am the **Implementer** - I make all decisions and execute all work autonomously.
- - Updated `_IRONCLAD_SYSTEM_PREFIX.md` (Rule 6: AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION → SUPERVISED EXECUTION WITH CHECKPOINTS)
- 2. `05_AUDITS_AND_REPORTS/IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md` - "Autonomous Build System" → "Supervised Build System"
- **Purpose:** Replace autonomous execution with collaborative, supervised, checkpoint-based implementation
- I'll continue reading through the entire file autonomously and provide a complete summary when done.
- - [x] Task 2: Verify MCI autonomous purge completion - **ALL UNINTENTIONAL REFERENCES REMOVED**
- - Identifies what it supersedes: "CLAUDE_CODE_AUTONOMOUS_MISSION_DIRECTIVE.pdf (DEPRECATED)"
- Found 4 files with unintentional "autonomous" references still remaining. Let me fix them:
- 1. `SESSION_SUMMARY_2026-01-20.md` - "Autonomous Coding Agent" → "Supervised Coding Agent"
- **Goal:** Replace ALL references to "autonomous" with "supervised" throughout MCI project
- 2. **Verify the MCI autonomous purge** - check that all replacements were made correctly
- - **FINAL DECLARATION**: Supervised execution commitments, REVOKES autonomous directive
- - States Claude operates as "EXECUTOR under User SUPERVISION, not as AUTONOMOUS AGENT"
- 4. `MCI_JAN20_22_COMPLETE_TRANSCRIPT.html` - All AUTONOMOUS references replaced
- Now I'll proceed with **Task 2: Verify the MCI autonomous purge is complete**.
- 3. `MCI_JAN23_COMPLETE_TRANSCRIPT.html` - All AUTONOMOUS references replaced
- - **Supersedes:** CLAUDE_CODE_AUTONOMOUS_MISSION_DIRECTIVE.pdf (DEPRECATED)
- - **Claude Code = EXECUTOR under User SUPERVISION, NOT AUTONOMOUS AGENT**
- - L658: Claude: "I must be transparent... I cannot work autonomously..."
- - Previous "AUTONOMOUS MISSION DIRECTIVE" is DEPRECATED and REVOKED
- 8. CLAUDE_CODE_AUTONOMOUS_MISSION_DIRECTIVE - Phase 9 (Governance)
- - Autonomous→Supervised purge: COMPLETE (verified in session 02)
- - Status: ACTIVE - Supersedes all previous autonomous directives
- - The last 5 lines (showing the final "autonomous purge" task)
- - Notes it "supersedes all previous autonomous directives"
- ### PHASE 4: AUTONOMOUS → SUPERVISED Purge (Lines 350-994)
- - Deprecated `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTONOMOUS_MISSION_DIRECTIVE.md`
- - **Summary:** "MCI Project Autonomous Purge Complete"
- - Explains the rejection of autonomous execution
- **PREAMBLE: REJECTION OF AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION**
- ## MCI AUTONOMOUS PURGE VERIFICATION COMPLETE
- - **⛔ AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION REVOKED ⛔**
