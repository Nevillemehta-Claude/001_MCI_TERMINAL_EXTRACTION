## ALL SCANNER REFERENCES


### SCANNER REF 1

1. **Continue session history reconstruction** - if you want to further process/export more session data
2. **Verify the MCI autonomous purge** - check that all replacements were made correctly
3. **Work on another project** - CIA-SIE-PURE or other projects I saw in your sessions
4. **Something else** - let me know what you'd like to focus on

---

### SCANNER REF 2

Let me check what session transcripts have already been created and what remains.

---

### SCANNER REF 3

I'll continue with session history reconstruction first, then verify the MCI purge.

---

### SCANNER REF 4

### PHASE 2: NASA Project (Abandoned) → MCI Checkpoint System (Lines 200-280)
**Goal:** Create new project "NASA" as mirror of MCI

---

### SCANNER REF 5

**Outcome:** User decided to abandon NASA and instead create `_SESSION_CHECKPOINTS` folder in MCI with `MASTER_CONTEXT.md` for checkpoint persistence

---

### SCANNER REF 6

**Priority 1 - Primary Documents:**
- Deprecated `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTONOMOUS_MISSION_DIRECTIVE.md`
- Created `SUPERVISED_MISSION_DIRECTIVE_v1.0.md`
- Updated `_IRONCLAD_SYSTEM_PREFIX.md` (Rule 6: AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION → SUPERVISED EXECUTION WITH CHECKPOINTS)
- Updated `CLAUDE_CODE_LAUNCH_COMMAND.md`

---

### SCANNER REF 7

### SESSION FINAL STATUS:
- **Summary:** "MCI Project Autonomous Purge Complete"
- **Checkpoint System:** Active at `/Users/nevillemehta/Downloads/PROJECTS/01_MCI/_SESSION_CHECKPOINTS/MASTER_CONTEXT.md`

---

### SCANNER REF 8

Now I'll proceed with **Task 2: Verify the MCI autonomous purge is complete**.

---

### SCANNER REF 9

### TASKS COMPLETED:
- [x] Task 1: Complete session history reconstruction - **READ FULL 32MB FILE**
- [x] Task 2: Verify MCI autonomous purge completion - **ALL UNINTENTIONAL REFERENCES REMOVED**

---

### SCANNER REF 10

Let me check for user requests throughout the session.

---

### SCANNER REF 11

Now I have the full picture of session 03. Key work done:
1. Document classification continued
2. MASTER_CONTEXT.md updates
3. Folder reorganization executed
4. HTML file creation (MCI_MASTER_LIFECYCLE_CONTROL_MAP.html) 
5. Q&A integration into HTML

---

### SCANNER REF 12

Let me verify current state and complete the pending verification.

---

### SCANNER REF 13

The HTML file exists (220KB). Let me complete the verification that was interrupted - checking Q&A entries and LTT design.

---

### SCANNER REF 14

Found the discrepancy: HTML has Q8-Q16 (9 entries) but header claims "11 Entries". Q1-Q7 are missing. Let me check what these should be.

---

### SCANNER REF 15

Fixed. Now let me verify the LTT (Lifecycle Tracking Tree) completeness that session 03 was checking.

---

### SCANNER REF 16

HTML has 6 tabs. Let me verify the LTT tab content.

---

### SCANNER REF 17

Let me verify the files-tab mirrors actual folder structure.

---

### SCANNER REF 18

Discrepancy: HTML shows 12 files, actual is 10. Let me check missing files.

---

### SCANNER REF 92

- **PROCESS (What We Do):**
  1. ERADICATE Previous Code
  2. BUILD UXMI Library
  3. BUILD Token Capture
  4. BUILD Scanner
  5. BUILD Ignition
  6. BUILD Telemetry
  7. BUILD Shutdown
  8. INTEGRATE & TEST

---

### SCANNER REF 93

  **WHAT MUST BE DONE?**
  1. ERADICATE all previous implementations (Alpaca, current code)
  2. BUILD UXMI component library FIRST (CR-005)
  3. BUILD each module in order: Token → Scanner → Ignition → Telemetry → Shutdown
  4. PASS each Quality Gate before proceeding
  5. INTEGRATE with CIA-SIE-PURE
  6. DEPLOY production-ready application

---

### SCANNER REF 94

**Summary of Document 9 (905 lines):**
- **TIER 1 MISSION CRITICAL** document - THE definitive specification
- **THE PROBLEM:** CIA-SIE-PURE is a headless trading engine - no visibility, no control
- **THE SOLUTION:** MCI is the COCKPIT - EYES and HANDS, not the BRAIN
- **13 Use Cases:** UC-001 to UC-013 across 4 groups (Token, Ignition, Telemetry, Alerts)
- **5 Operational Phases:** Token Capture → Pre-Ignition → Ignition → Telemetry → Shutdown
- **FMEA (Failure Mode Analysis):** 13 failure modes identified with mitigations
- **CLEAN SLATE PROTOCOL:** Eradicate all previous implementations including Alpaca code
- **MANDATORY BUILD ORDER:** UXMI FIRST → Token → Scanner → Ignition → Telemetry → Shutdown
- **5 Constitutional Requirements:** CR-001 to CR-005 (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **6 Quality Gates:** QG-1 to QG-6, must PASS each before proceeding
- **15 Mermaid diagrams** documenting architecture and workflows
- **SUPERSEDES all previous understanding** of MCI purpose and scope

---

### SCANNER REF 95

**Key Memory Block from Document 9:**
- This is THE BIBLE for MCI development
- MCI = COCKPIT (observes/controls), CIA-SIE-PURE = ENGINE (executes)
- Build order: UXMI → Token → Scanner → Ignition → Telemetry → Shutdown
- Clean Slate = DELETE all previous code in 04_IMPLEMENTATION/mci/
- BUT PRESERVE: 00-03, 05, _SESSION_CHECKPOINTS, and this specification
- Deviation from this document requires FORMAL AMENDMENT
