## SECTION 9 — KNOWN GAPS & ACCEPTED RISKS

### Accepted Risks (Documented)

1. **E2E Integration Testing** — Deferred until E2E infrastructure is established
2. **Real Hardware/Network Testing** — Not possible in current environment
3. **CIA-SIE-PURE Live Validation** — Requires external access not currently available

### Items Requiring Future Attention

1. **GitHub Actions CI/CD** — Workflows defined but not executed
2. **Production Deployment** — Infrastructure not in scope
3. **External System Integration** — Awaiting separate authorization
