- **13 Use Cases:** UC-001 to UC-013 across 4 groups (Token, Ignition, Telemetry, Alerts)
- **5 Operational Phases:** Token Capture → Pre-Ignition → Ignition → Telemetry → Shutdown
- **FMEA (Failure Mode Analysis):** 13 failure modes identified with mitigations
- **CLEAN SLATE PROTOCOL:** Eradicate all previous implementations including Alpaca code
- **MANDATORY BUILD ORDER:** UXMI FIRST → Token → Scanner → Ignition → Telemetry → Shutdown
- **5 Constitutional Requirements:** CR-001 to CR-005 (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **6 Quality Gates:** QG-1 to QG-6, must PASS each before proceeding
- **15 Mermaid diagrams** documenting architecture and workflows
