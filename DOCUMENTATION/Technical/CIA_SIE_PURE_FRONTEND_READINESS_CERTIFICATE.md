## PARTIAL CONFORMANCE ITEMS

The following items are partially satisfied due to dependency on external integration:

### Gap 1: PP-002 Signal Contradiction Display
- **Status:** Architecture complete, awaiting CIA-SIE-PURE engine signals
- **Impact:** Non-blocking for prototype, blocking for OPS
- **Remediation:** Engine integration required

### Gap 2: PP-002 Side-by-Side Disagreement
- **Status:** Architecture complete, awaiting signal data
- **Impact:** Non-blocking for prototype, blocking for OPS
- **Remediation:** Engine integration required

---

- ✅ All constitutional requirements (CR-001 through CR-005) are satisfied
- ✅ All philosophical principles (PP-001 through PP-003) are implemented
- ✅ Frontend renders backend truth faithfully (no semantic drift)
- ✅ No prohibited inference patterns exist in UI layer
- ✅ GitHub verification gate provides independent compliance checking
- ✅ Prototype is suitable for human inspection and trust calibration

---

## WHAT IS NOT CERTIFIED

- ❌ Live trading capability (requires engine integration)
- ❌ Real-time signal contradiction display (requires engine data)

---

## HUMAN SIGN-OFF REQUIRED

This certificate requires human verification before the frontend can proceed to:
1. OPS integration testing
2. Production deployment
3. Live trading environment connection
